Pago Dingo is a pseudonym (pen name) inspired by the idea of a ficticious farmer who herds dingoes (while also being a dog himself). These blog entries are like said dingoes. They each have meanings and personalities of their own, but are only about as well-put together as dog's thoughts.

The spelling of the name, as well as its phonetic pronunciation, also makes it pretty fun to say.

In Spanish, pago means payment. And a dingo is a form of dog. Therefore, you could also argue that Pago Dingo is spanish for Dog The Bounty Hunter.

I have over 100k characters of text in just my apple notes alone. Thousands of dingoes adopted over the past ~10 years. And across all of the other apps I use to write, there could  very easily be three times that. 

I'm starting this blog to officially open the dingo farm for business, and let these notes roam freely across the internet, like all dogs should. üêæ
